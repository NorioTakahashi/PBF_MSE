#' Calculates the TAC based on HCR2 from the NC15 Annex F
#' 
#' This HCR has the following specifications
#' -computes a TAC
#' -no rebuilding plan, TAC = TAC min if SSBcur<SSBlim
#' -management action occurs when either SSBcur<SSBthreshold or when SSBcur<SSBlim with a 50% probability
#' -allocation of the TAC is simply based on the average 2017-2019 allocation ***need to develop this to be based on 
#' proportional fishing impact
#' -HCR controls all fleets
#' 
#' Here the exploitation rate is the ratio of the total catch in weight over the total biomass
#' @param ssout SS output file
#' @param dat specifies the data frame which contains the sprseries data extracted from the stock assessment output
#' @param yr specifies the year for which to extract the current total biomass
#' @param SSBlim the limit biomass reference point
#' @param Ftgt is the fishing intensity that produces the specified SPR target. It is computed as an exploitation rate, 
#' which is the ratio of the total annual catch to the biomass at the start of the year.
#' @param cr is the catch ratio per fleet (by gear/country)
#' @param err is the implementation error per fleet , if 1 no implementation error

#' @return A TAC in mt
